# -Human-Activity-Recognition-
This project builds a Human Activity Recognition system using an LSTM neural network in TensorFlow. It processes segmented time-series sensor data, trains a multi-layer LSTM model, and evaluates performance using accuracy, loss curves, and a confusion matrix for activity classification.
